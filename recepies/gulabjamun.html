    <h3>Recepie</h3>
    <p>thentically and traditionally Gulab Jamun recipe is always made with khoya. Khoya or mawa is the Hindi term for evaporated milk solids. It is made by continuously simmering the milk on a low heat until most of the moisture evaporates.

       <p> There are 3 different types of khoya that you get in the Indian market. To make gulab jamun recipe you need to use “chikna khoya” or “dhaap khoya”. The word ‘chikna’ means smooth. Thus basically this khoya has a smooth and soft texture. It has more moisture than the other two varieties of khoya viz ‘danedar khoya’ and ‘batti khoya’.
        
     </p>>   You can easily make chikna khoya at home. You can check the method of making khoya at this link -> Khoya Recipe. You can also buy khoya from a Indian sweet shop.
        
        My gulab jamun recipe is an easy one that yields delicious, soft and tasty jamun. My recipe is adapted from my cooking school which I have been making for decades and has never failed.
        
        In fact I have made this gulab jamun recipe numerous times. Besides khoya you will also need paneer to make the jamun. The addition of these two ingredients gives a soft texture.</p>
